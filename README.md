## Term Project of IST 597-001: Stock Market Prediction
Stock market prediction is an very important topic in financial economics. A good prediction of a stock's future movement can bring significant profit.

### Goals
The goal of this project is to layout deep investment techniques in financial markets using deep learning models. Stock market prediction always involve variety of data which is difficult to design an ideal economic modelv. Deep learning models are able to explot potentiallu non-linear patterns in such data which can help prediction.

### Basic Approach
Since the stock market data can be considered as time-series data, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be applied to predict strockmarket movement. RNN is one type of newural networks that take advatanges of the the sequential nature of time-series data. We will also implement some traditional methods (e.g. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, etc.) as baseline model. In addition, if time permits, we will also try sentiment/textual analysis and see its influence on stock market prediction.

### Anticipated Results
We will compare the our proposed approach with the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We anticipate it can take advantages of the sequential nature and outperform the baseline models.
